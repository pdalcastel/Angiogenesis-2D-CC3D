<!-- 
This simulation was written by James Glazier, Pedro Dal-Castel and Joel Vanin.
This simple CC3D demo demonstrates the spontaneous organization of cells as narrow filaments.
In biology, this phenomenon happens among enodthelial cells during the vascular development.
I (Pedro) will present the important aspects that make this simulation work, then I 
will make some considerations about investigating parameters to obtain different results.

<!-- 
Let me now tell you what parameters are interesting to sweep and in what range.

I will start by quickly explaining how the simulation works.

_____ HOW SIMULATION WORKS

First, cells start all spread out. They secrete VEGF. VEGF diffuses through 
space and decays, forming gradients.

As all cells are secreting VEGF, gradients become milder between closer cells and 
steeper towards empty medium regions.

Note that VEGF, in the cell point of view, points inwards, except if the cell belongs
to a large blob of cells, in that case, gradient will point towards the blob center.

As cells are attracted by VEGF, they tend to close the distance between closer cells.

When two cells are side by side, they sense less force in the major axis direction
and stronger force in the minor axis direction, because VEGF gradient is steeper in
the sides than in the extremes.

Now think of a cluster of 10 cells. If it randomly achieves an elipsoidal shape, it 
will be compressed by the sides, which favors the elongation of the cluster. This 
means that filaments are stable structure in the system. 

In response to VEGF, neighboring filaments tend to connect, and they keep sending 
branches to keep small width.

One behavior is particularly interesting: notice how small regions inside filaments
tend to collapse due to VEGF pressure. These collapses form blobs, which are unstable.
Then, this blob starts strengthening connected filaments, which in turn start sending
new filaments elsewhere. This behavior prevents the system from achieving equilibrium.
This means that in a single simulation you can see multiple angiogenesis patterns 
forming and destroying successively.

_____ INTERESTING PARAMETERS TO SWEEP

To play with angiogenesis behavior, consider changing:

1) Contact energy Medium-EC from 5 to 15
2) Chemtoaxis saturation parameter from 0.25 to 1.0 (it will effectively change 
    chemotactic force, so don't bother sweeping lambda)
3) Length constraint: test lambda = 5
4) Decay constant from 0.125 to 0.5 
5) Gap between cells from 2 to 8

As an activity for you, take notes of the effects of each parameter in the behavior of
the system. Then try to explain mechanistically how each parameter affects it.

If your cells get stuck in a big blob of cells, try a really high decay value and watch
it sending filaments frenetically everywhere.

You may notice how easy it is to achieve same patterns with different parameters. This
is part of the reason why it is so difficult to quantitatively characterize an
angiogenesis image.
